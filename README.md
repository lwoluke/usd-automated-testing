# USD Automated Testing

## Overview
USD Automated Testing is a command-line utility for validating USD files. This tool ensures your USD assets comply with basic standards by checking the validity of:
- Geometry (usdGeom)
- Shaders (usdShade)
- Layer structure

This program is built using Pixar's Universal Scene Description (USD) libraries, making it ideal for workflows in animation, VFX, and gaming pipelines.

## Prerequisites
Before building or using a prebuilt binary and then running this project, ensure you have the following:

### Required Tools
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (version 3.16 or later)

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/lwoluke/automated-usd-testing.git
cd automated-usd-testing
```

### Step 2: Create USD build or Download Prebuilt Binary
Choice #1: Follow the [official USD build instructions](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD/tree/release?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-and-building-the-code) to set up the USD libraries.

Choice #2: Visit the [Nvidia Pre-Built OpenUSD Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/usd) section to install the USD libraries.

Make sure the USD libraries are either built or downloaded, and then placed into the `usd` directory within the project.

### Step 3: Build the Project on Your Machine
Navigate to the build directory and compile the project:
```
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
This will produce the `usdTestRunner` so you can test USD files on the command line.

## Continuous Integration Setup

To facilitate automated testing and building, you'll need to set up a Jenkins server along with build agents for both Windows and Linux environments. Below are the instructions to get everything up and running.

### Jenkins Server Setup

While I have configured Jenkins locally for my setup, you'll need to set up your own Jenkins server. Using the commands provided below can help streamline this process.

### Initial Installation

   Follow the [official Jenkins installation guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/) to install Jenkins on your preferred platform.

### External Access Configuration

   To make your local Jenkins server accessible, use ngrok:

   ```bash
   ngrok http --url=<your-ngrok-url> 8080
   ```
   To access your free static url, go to the [Ngrok Setup Page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/windows)

### Build Agent Configuration
You'll need to run build agents on both Linux and Windows to enable Jenkins to execute builds on these platforms.

### Linux Build Agent Setup
Execute the following command on your Linux machine to start the Jenkins build agent:

```bash
java -jar agent.jar -url <your-ngrok-url> -secret @secret-file -name "linux_agent" -webSocket -workDir "/home/jenkins/agent"
```
Ensure that agent.jar is downloaded from your Jenkins server and that the secret-file contains the appropriate secret key provided by Jenkins.

### Windows Build Agent Setup
On your Windows machine, run the following commands to set up the Jenkins build agent:

```bash
java -jar agent.jar -url <your-ngrok-url> -secret @secret-file -name "windows_agent" -webSocket -workDir "C:\jenkins\agent"
```
Make sure to replace the secret key with the one generated by your Jenkins server.

## Usage
The usdTestRunner utility validates USD files by checking for essential components like geometry and shaders.

### Running the Test Runner
Use the following command to run the test runner:
```
./usdTestRunner path/to/usdfile.usda
```

---

### Example Output
```
Opened USD file Successfully.

[PASS] Validate Geometry: All geometry prims are valid.
[PASS] Validate Shader: All shaders in the scene are valid.
[PASS] Validate Layer Structure: Layer stack is valid.

Summary:
  Passed: 3
  Failed: 0

Congratulations, all tests were successful!
```

## Future Development Ideas
Ideas include:
- Allow users to run specific tests (e.g., --only-geometry, --skip-shaders) for greater flexibility.
- Save validation results to a text or JSON file for easier sharing and review.
- Expand to support additional evaluation types, such as asset hierarchy validation or custom plugin integrations.
- Add more test files to handle edge cases, ensuring robustness against unusual or invalid USD configurations.
